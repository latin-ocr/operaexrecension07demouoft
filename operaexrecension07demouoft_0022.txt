1060 ADVERSUS APHOBUM Ι.

b. SEPARATE ACCOUNT OF APHOBIJS.

P. 825, 24. Acknowledged debt in capital (comp. p.
824, 14.) to the amount of . 108 minae
To this we must annet< for interest . . 82

P. 824, 9. 825, 26. .. 3 10

Observati0n.—108 minae of capital make, in ten years,
129 „ 60 dr. for interest.

 

 

3 57 ,‚ 60 dr. capital together with interest.

But p. 824, 9. we read, as the sum total, only τρία τάλαντα
καὶ χιλίας. The entire sum of capital and interest I have noti-
fied on the margin of my Paris edition by ‘⁶ f. πεντακισχιλίας.”
But we read p. 825, 26. μάλιστα τρία τάλαντα καὶ χιλίας, for
which one would at any rate have expected πλέον ἢ τρία τά-
λαντα, or (if the interest upon the whole capital is meant to be
taken for ten years) μάλιστα τέτταρα τάλαντα, without χιλίας.
But to make this conjecture were an act of great audaeity,
especially as all the MSS. are agreed in the numbers of both
passages. It would be better, with one of the Florentine (59,
17.) and probably with other accurater pointed MSS.. to put a
comma after μάλιστα, and to unite this with the preceding δέκ’
ἐτῶν. So 111 Herodotus 7, 22. ἐκ τριῶν ἐτέων κου μάλιστα. (Comp.
7, 30.) 111 Denlostll. p. 819, 3.-τὸ ἔργον τῶν δέκα ἐτῶν, μάλιστα
τρία τάλαντα, 0110 might join μάλιστα with the two figures, be-
tween which it is placed, but next to that with the sum of
money. We could thus let καὶ χιλίας stand in both passages,
but must assume that the reason why Demosthenes reckons
so little interest in this place is, either because there were
some os (lead property among the capital of 108 minae, which
I do not believe to have been the case, as this distinction was
not observed with the other guardians ; or, which seems to me
most probable, from p. 824, where a difference is expressly
made between the sums received immediately and later on3
that Aphobus also had recehed, later 011, a part of the dowry
(30 minae, see Table V.) and the two years' proceeds from the
knife-manufactory (30 minae, see ibid.)0.

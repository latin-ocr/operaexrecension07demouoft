926, 4. μετ’ Ἀρκτοῦρον] After the rising of the star Arcturus,
which in Hesiod's time took place sixty (lays after the solstiee
(Opera et Dies 566.) According to Ptolemy it was on the se-
cond of September. The ‹liserepaney is thus explained by Cap-
tain W. H. Smyth, R. N.: ‘⁶ The differenee in the rising of
Arcturus is the effect of the precession of the esliiixioxes—54}‘'
annually, and from 1105101Γ5 mention of when it took place 111
1115 time, the important chronological point of his age is gained.
The star however, though fine, was reckoned ungenial in its
influences; 31111 the chance between the summer 31111 autumnal
Etesian winds being precursed by eight or ten days of squally
weather, the prodromi of old—was ascribed to the direct power
of Arcturus, instead of the alternation consequent upon the
solar march. The times of the periodical changes of the Etesiae
are still objects of concern.” Gibbon, vol. 1. 0. x. saJS, referring
to Vogsasyes dc Clam-din, vol. 1. p. 45: ‘⁶ To navigate the Euxine
before the month of May, or after that of September, is esteemed
by the modern Turlzs the most unquestionable instance of rash-
11055 31111 folly.” The same caution seems to have prevailed in
the eastern part of the Mediterranean. Compare Acts 27, 9,
where, the vessel being 011 the coast of Crete, it is said, καὶ ὄντος
ἤδη ἐπισφαλοῦς τοῦ πλοὸς, διὰ τὸ καὶ τὴν νηστείαν ἤδη παρεληλυθέ-
ναι, that 15 the day of Atonement‚ on the tenth day of the
J ewish month Tisri, which fell in that year, according to Burton,
on the nineteenth of September. PENROSE.

post Arcturi oceasum, cavebatur in usuram, trecentenae drach-
mae in millenas. Ergo periculosa erat illa navigatio. Sed
nullo non 311111 tempore importuosum erat litus Chalcedonense‚
multo autem magis sub autumni initia. REISK.

1054 ADVERSUS APHOBUM I.

Observation 2.—The management.——Schmeisser (De re tute—
lari p. 12.) asserts that Demosthenes* father wished the manage·
ment of the property to be conducted conjointly by the three
guardians, because in Aph. ΙΙ. p. 840, 14. we read ἐμὲ δὲ πᾶσι
κοινῇ μετὰ τῶν χρημάτων παρακατατιθέμενος. But, ab any rate, it
does not follow from this passage that they also did so. If they
had leased the estate (τὸν οἶκον), as the father directed, the
trouble attending the management was not in other respects
great. But we have proof of a separate management in Aph. I.
p. 542. foll. Thus Aphobus had the management of the knife-
manufactory for the space of two years, Therippides for seven
years. (For one year the factory must have been stopped.)
Besides, as Aphobus has to replace for himself alone the dowry
(which, with about ten years' interest, amounts to nearly 3 ta-
lents), he would have been forced to pay as much as 10 talents
more (which is the third of the entire claim made upon the
guardians), making in all about 13 talents. But throughout
there is only a trifle more than [Ο talents demanded of him. In
Aph. I. p. 834, 25. the ἐπωβελία is put down at 100 minae, con-
sequently the claim upon him was six times as much, or 10

talents. (See Aph. II. ξ. 15. 22. III. end.)

TABLE II.

AMOUNT OF THE PROPERTY ACCORDING TO THE ASSEssMENT MADE BY
THE GUARDIANS.

Aph. I. §. 8, 9: comp. II. ξ. 5. The guardians impose a tax of
500 dr. (=5 minae, Aph. ΙΙΙ. p. 862, 11.) upon every 25 minae:
W—-s-

Aph. I. p. 816, 1. Now since they take 3 talents as the taxable
capital or timema, and this is ὲ of 15, it follows that the property
(οὐσία) must have been equal to 15 talents.

Aph. Ι. p. 825, 7. Of this assessment they paid a tribute (εἰσφορά)
of 18 minae, i. e. ᾖ of the taxable capital, or 5¹0⁷ of the property.

Compare Boeckh. Economy of Ath. vol, 2. p. 53. (517. Eng.
transl. znd edit.)

TABLE ΠΙ.

INVENTORY.
a. Working Property.
(1.) Aph. I. p. 816, 5. Cutlers, from 32 to 33 in num-
ber, amount yearly to 30 minae.
They represent a capital of . . . . . . . . 190 minae
For 33 >< 5} minae=189} minae, in round numbers 190
minae.

That Demosthenes valued one cutler at 53- minae follows
from the sum total quoted by him, 4 tal. 50 minae. ”

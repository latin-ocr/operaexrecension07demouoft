³· Aphohus did not receive the dowry
of 80 minae at once immediately aster
1110 father's death, but, as appears from
Aph. Ι. p. 817, 20., comp. p. 824. he
first had the tankards, which had been
valned at 50 minae, and then the ran-
som for the slaves, till the 80 minae
were made up. Now, although ten
years are generally mentioned in round
1101011015, in speaking of the interest of
this sum(111.p.854, 22. I. p. 819, 3.),
yet this was not the complete number of
years; hence we read (Ι. 011111),”Αφοβον

δὲ μηδ’ ἢν ἔλαβε προῖκ’ ἐθέλοντ’ ἀποδοῦ-
ναι καὶ ταῦτ’ ἔτει δεκάτῳ. We must not
confound with this the entire ten years
of the guardianship during which the
guardians of Demosthenes had the re-
maining property in their management,
and (Onet. II. p. 880.) it is very pro-
perly ohserved ὅλοις ἔτεσι-δέκα τάμὰ

making this distinction, people find a
chronological discrepancy. Comp. See-
